# Generative AI PHP Translation Project

## Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md for PHP version
- [ ] Create PHP-specific usage examples
- [ ] Document any differences from the Python version

## Differences from the Python Version

1. **Language Syntax**: The PHP version uses PHP syntax, which differs from Python in terms of variable declaration, function definitions, and class structures.

2. **Error Handling**: PHP uses exceptions like `GenerativeAIException`, `InvalidArgumentException`, etc., whereas Python uses its own exception classes.

3. **Dependency Management**: PHP uses Composer for dependency management, while Python uses pip.

4. **Asynchronous Operations**: The PHP version does not support asynchronous operations natively, unlike Python which can use `async` and `await`.

5. **Type System**: PHP has a more flexible type system compared to Python's strict typing introduced in recent versions.

6. **Client Configuration**: The PHP client configuration is done through an associative array, whereas Python uses function arguments and environment variables.

7. **Library Usage**: The PHP version uses Guzzle for HTTP requests, while Python uses libraries like `requests` or `http.client`.

8. **File Handling**: PHP handles file uploads and downloads differently, using streams and file paths, compared to Python's file handling mechanisms.

9. **Testing Framework**: PHP uses PHPUnit for testing, while Python uses unittest or pytest.

10. **Namespace and Imports**: PHP uses namespaces and the `use` keyword for imports, while Python uses the `import` statement.

Remember to update this task list as you progress through the translation project.
