# Generative AI PHP Translation Project

## Project Setup
- [x] Initialize PHP project structure
- [x] Set up Composer for dependency management
- [x] Configure PHP 8.3 environment
- [x] Set up PHPUnit for testing

## Core Components Translation
- [x] Translate GenerativeModel class
  - [x] Implement constructor
  - [x] Translate generate_content method
  - [x] Translate count_tokens method
  - [x] Implement start_chat method
- [x] Translate ChatSession class
  - [x] Implement constructor
  - [x] Translate send_message method
  - [x] Implement other helper methods

## API Client Translation
- [x] Create PHP client for API interactions
  - [x] Implement authentication mechanism
  - [x] Create methods for API endpoints
  - [x] Handle request/response serialization/deserialization

## Type System Implementation
- [x] Define strict type hints for all classes and methods
- [x] Create type definitions for API request/response objects
- [x] Implement PHPDoc comments for better IDE support

## Utility Functions Translation
- [x] Translate helper functions from Python to PHP
- [x] Implement PHP equivalents for Python-specific operations

## Error Handling and Exceptions
- [x] Create custom exception classes
- [x] Implement error handling mechanisms

## Configuration and Environment
- [ ] Implement `configure()` method to set up API keys and client options
- [ ] Implement configuration loading mechanism
- [ ] Handle environment variables and API keys

## Client Management
- [x] Implement client management similar to `_ClientManager` in Python
- [x] Handle default client configuration and instantiation

## Protos and Serialization
- [x] Implement serialization and deserialization of protos
- [x] Handle conversion between PHP arrays and protos

## Error Handling
- [x] Implement error handling similar to Python's exception classes
- [x] Translate Python exceptions to PHP exceptions

## Utility Functions
- [x] Translate utility functions like `flatten_update_paths` to PHP

## Testing
- [ ] Set up PHPUnit test suite
- [ ] Implement tests for client configuration and initialization
- [ ] Translate existing Python tests to PHP
- [ ] Implement additional PHP-specific tests

## Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md for PHP version
- [ ] Create PHP-specific usage examples
- [ ] Document any differences from the Python version

## Async Support
- [ ] Consider implementing async support if applicable in PHP

## Continuous Integration
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for PHP project
- [ ] Configure automated testing and linting

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile PHP implementation
- [ ] Optimize critical paths

## Packaging and Distribution
- [ ] Prepare package for Composer distribution
- [ ] Create release process

## Final Review and Testing
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing of all components
- [ ] Perform security review
- [ ] Ensure PHP 8.3 compatibility

## Launch Preparation
- [ ] Prepare changelog
- [ ] Update version numbers
- [ ] Prepare release notes

Remember to update this task list as you progress through the translation project.
